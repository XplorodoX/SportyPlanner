# SportyPlanner

An iOS sample application for planning workouts and cardio sessions. This version includes simple data models for workouts, exercises and cardio sessions. A `WorkoutPlanner` demonstrates how a local language model could generate a basic schedule.

The project uses SwiftData for persistence and provides placeholder views to display workouts and cardio activities. Map support and HealthKit integration are left as future work.

## Shortcuts Support

SportyPlanner now provides an **Add Workout** intent that can be used from the Shortcuts app or via Siri to quickly create new workouts.
